# A beat tracking algorithm in MATLAB

This is a basic beat tracker that has been developed to be used inside the [impulse noise detection algorithm](https://github.com/matbra/impulse-noise-detector). The functionality is described to some detail in the article associated with the impulse noise detector.

The algorithm uses a coarse tempo estimate obtained with a tempo estimation algorithm by [Matthew Davies](http://telecom.inescporto.pt/~mdavies/). It can be downloaded [here](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/davies-beat-tracker) and must be copied to the _resources/davies_beat_tracker_ subdirectory.
